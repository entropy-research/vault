# vault
Obsidian vault for coordination and excalidraw saving.

Installation:  
Clone the repo.  
[Install Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download)  
Open an Obsidian Vault at the location of the cloned repo.  
[See this thread on the Obsidian forums about how to install and configure Obsidian Git.]  
You will need to re-enable Excalibrain once after installation; it can't detect that Excalidraw is installed when they're installed simultaneously. Head to the Settings cog in the bottom-left and disable/re-enable Community Plugins as needed.  

After updating an Excalidraw template, note, or other resource, use CTRL+P to find Git: Commit all Changes and Git: Push.
